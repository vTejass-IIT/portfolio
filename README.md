# Next Portfolio

This is my "developer's" porfolio, built with React and TailwindCSS. It is hosted on Gitpages and self-hosted on port 3000.

## Frameworks

**Client:** React, TailwindCSS, SCSS
## Link

The portfolio (main branch) is available at [https://github.com/vTejass-IIT/portfolio]
I have setup git husky and git actions to automatically deploy when i push changes to main.
## Deployment

To deploy my portfolio (or your own) run:

```bash
  npm run start

Otherwise, when you're working on it, use
